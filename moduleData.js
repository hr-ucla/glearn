    content: `<text>Recursion is a technique for solving problems wherein a function makes calls to itself. By doing so, it can complete a small amount of the processing, and delegate the rest of the problem to the recursive calls.\n\nConsider the following function:</text><codesnippet>var eat = function(meal){\n  console.log('meal before bite:', meal);\n  console.log('now eating', meal.pop());\n  if(meal.length){\n    eat(meal);\n  } else {\n    console.log('done with the meal!');\n  }\n}</codesnippet><text>Which produces this output:</text><codesnippet>eat(['soup', 'potatoes', 'fish']);\n// => meal before bite: ["soup", "potatoes", "fish"]\n// => now eating fish\n// => meal before bite: ["soup", "potatoes"]\n// => now eating potatoes\n// => meal before bite: ["soup"]\n// => now eating soup\n// => done with the meal!</codesnippet><text>You can use recursion on problems where smaller parts of the problem look the same as the larger problem as a whole.\n\nIn this sprint, you'll be reimplementing parts of the browser that involve recursion. In so doing, don't use the things you're reimplementing, or any other built-in shortcuts that make these problems trivial. (You'll probably know if you're cheating, but feel free to ask us if you're not sure.)\n\nIn this sprint, you'll be reimplementing parts of the browser that involve recursion.

When we reimplement new browser functionality in older browsers, it's called a "polyfill".)</text><title1>New for the Review Sprint</title1><title2>Review Sprint Repo</title2><text><b>The repo you will be working out of will be a different repo from Precourse.</b> Look on Github for <code>recursion-review</code> instead of <code>recursion</code>.
