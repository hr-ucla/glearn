  A mobile adaptation of the already existing educational platform for the Galvanize @ Hack Reactor Advanced Software Engineering Immersive accessed through <a href="https://auth.galvanize.com/sign_in" target="_blank">https://auth.galvanize.com/sign_in</a>. The inspiration for adapting this application on the mobile platform was to increase its accessibility to the students enrolled in the immersive, while also implementing two, additional features: a search bar and google authentication.
